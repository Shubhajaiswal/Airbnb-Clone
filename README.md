**AIRBNB CLONE**

*Made using React, HTML, CSS, JS, Material-ui*

Airbnb is an online application for booking homestays and hotels. It allows home owners to list their property on the site which can be booked by the travellers.

The clone created holds all the features of the site, allowing dynamic user experience and showcasing the interaction between the user and the application.
I have used various function of react to reach the feel of AirBnb with designs and transitions, there are multiple picture available of the listed property, the user can filter accoring to the need, the map can be used to look around the area of the stay, the account section has a menu to choose from.
Feature of react like Function, hoocks, etc has been used.
Material UI is used to imporve the look and feel of the assests.
I have used a optmized approach for the code with maintained structure and it is surely scalable.

With more time I want to incorporate even more features, to make it as or more user oriented than the site.

*To run on your local setup*
1. Clone the project on your device and open in any editor.
2. Open the terminal and use _**npm install**_ to get the dependecies and scripts.
3. To run the project use _**npm start**_, in the local server Airbnb Clone will run.
